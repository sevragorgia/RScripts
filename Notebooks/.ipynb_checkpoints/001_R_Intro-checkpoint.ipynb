    "\n",
    "Here I provide a number of examples that can be run in an interactive manner and should help the student get familiar with R as a tool for the analysis of data.\n",

    "Maybe the first thing you need to know is that R can be used in interactive mode. You can ask R to add two number, for example, and R will add them for you and give you the results back. For instance, if you run the following operation (Press Ctrl+Enter while the code snipped is selected), R will output **2**."
